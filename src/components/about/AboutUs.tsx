            Strikers Entertainment Center was established in 1968 as a 10 lane
            bowling alley, it was originally known as Pine Ridge Lanes. In 1987,
            Pine Ridge Lanes was purchased by James Sager. James made major
            changes, including: a 16 lane increase, automatic scoring and a name
            change from Pine Ridge to Strikers Entertainment Center, as we know
            it today. In 2016, Strikers underwent new ownership by 3 brothers:
            Doug Carl, James Carl, and Brother in Law, Rob Sheets. Since the
            transition to the new ownership, theyâ€™ve made major changes. One of
            the key changes is the addition of Ridge Runners Sports Bar and
            Grill. The brothers felt that the community needed an atmosphere for
            those looking to have a leisurely hangout with some great friends
            over a cold drink. They have also introduced two pool tables, two
            volley ball courts, and five sets of horseshoes pits. The changes
            mentioned here are just the tip of the ice berg under the long-term
            plan for Strikers in serving the local community and creating an
            all-in-one center for fun and entertainment.
